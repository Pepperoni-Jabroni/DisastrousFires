# Disastrous Fires
Makes fires in your world disastrous & resourceful

This mod revisits Fire in Minecraft in an attempt to make fires more destructive *and* resourceful by doing the following:
- Re-adding the ability for Grass Blocks to catch fire
- Making Fires generate a new resource, "Soot", on walls and ceilings up to 6 blocks above the Fire
- Soot can be used as ink, dye, gunpowder, and a new explosive Soot Block
- Adding "Burned" variants of blocks, such as logs and leaves
- Adding conditionally spawning new resource, "Ash", appearing as "Ash Layers" (like Snow Layers)
- Ash can be used as dye, bonemeal, clay, and a new Ash Block, which extinguishes flames which touch it
- Adding 2 new tools to fight fires with:
   - Extinguisher: Sprays foam to extinguish flames
   - Fire Helmet: Negates fire tick damage when worn
- Burned Logs drop Charcoal when chopped with an axe
- Burned blocks will degenerate and leave an area looking normal eventually

NOTE: A single wildfire can encompass dozens of chunks and burn infinitely if not managed properly. Periodic back-ups are recommended. I am not responsible for burned structures or world damage.
